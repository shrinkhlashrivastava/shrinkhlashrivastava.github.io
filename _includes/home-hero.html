            I am a UI/UX designer whose design philosophies stem from the lack of empathy in the world around us and is deeply fueled by insatiable curiosity alongside the love of solving real user problems. Currently, as a fresher intern, I am trying to cultivate a design voice during my work in UI/UX design through active engagement, meaningful conversations, and passion-driven work that involves creating user interfaces that extend beyond aesthetics, incorporating functionality and significance. I believe that a good design demonstrates an extraordinary capability of valuing the time and attention the users provide. I consider myself fortunate to be working across the full design process, starting with research, wireframes, prototypes, and culminating in building high-fidelity prototypes because all of these contribute to the crafting of purpose-driven products. It is not only the tools that help me bring my ideas to life, like Figma, that interest me, but what lies beyond the screens excites me the most. As I continue to discover more about myself, exploring my design style, I know one thing for certain. What is going to ground me is intentionally designing work that is collaborative, human-centered, and driven by the intention of deconstructing the barriers we face.

            I am a UI/UX designer whose design principles are derived from the world's absence of empathy and is highly driven by insatiable curiosity in combination with the affection for resolving real user issues. At present, as a fresh intern, I am attempting to develop a design voice while working in UI/UX design through active contribution, relevant discussions, and passion-fueled work consisting of designing user interfaces that are more than just looks, including functionality and meaning. In my opinion, a good design reflects an unparalleled ability to appreciate the time and attention the users give.

            I feel privileged to be working throughout the entire design process, beginning with research, wireframes, prototypes, and ending with the creation of high-fidelity prototypes because all these go into shaping purposeful products. It is not just the tools that assist me in creating my ideas, such as Figma, which fascinate me, but what happens outside of the screens most fascinates me.

            As I keep learning more about myself, finding out about my design approach, I do know one thing for sure. What will anchor me is purposefully creating work that is collaborative, human-centric, and powered by the intention of dismantling the obstacles we are confronted with.
