# Hi, Iâ€™m [Your Name] ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a **UI/UX designer** passionate about crafting meaningful, functional, and human-centered experiences. My journey into design is driven by a deep curiosity for how people interact with technology and a strong desire to reduce the friction they face.

I believe design is not just about making things look goodâ€”it's about solving real problems with empathy and intention. I aim to design interfaces that not only serve a purpose but also respect usersâ€™ time and attention.

## What I care about

- **Designing with empathy**: Users are at the heart of every product I create.
- **Purpose-driven work**: I strive to align design goals with real-world needs.
- **Clarity over cleverness**: Good design should be intuitive, not confusing.
- **Collaboration**: I thrive in environments where design is a team sport.

## What Iâ€™m doing now

Currently, Iâ€™m working as a **design intern at [FirstContact](https://www.firstcontact.lgbt/)**, helping build tools that are inclusive and impactful. Iâ€™m learning how to articulate my design decisions, gather feedback effectively, and iterate with intention.

Outside of work, Iâ€™m exploring:

- Motion design & microinteractions
- Accessibility and inclusive design
- How to bring joy into interfaces âœ¨

## Tools I use

- **Design**: Figma, Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop  
- **Prototyping**: Framer, FigJam  
- **Code**: HTML/CSS, a bit of JS  
- **Other**: Notion, Obsidian, Pen & paper
