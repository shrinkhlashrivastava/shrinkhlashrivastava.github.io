# Hi, Iâ€™m Shrinkhla ðŸ‘‹
### From Curiosity to Crafting Design

Iâ€™m a **UX/UI Designer** who is convinced that good design shouldn't be loud but is instead thoughtful, quiet, and intuitive. My journey toward design was inspired by a simple question: Why is it that some online interactions feel so natural, but others are frustratingly disconnected?

That inquiry led to an enthusiasm for not just creating something beautiful, but also something comfortable. Now, I'm realizing that passion in the form of hands-on experience as a design intern, learning what it is to construct with compassion and intention.

## Why I Design

Design is more than pixels on a screen. It is about solving real problems in ways that are respectful to people's time, attention, and feelings. I believe in creating interfaces that steer instead of overwhelm, that help instead of distract.

For me, good design happens when you step into the user's shoes, listen carefully, and pose the hard questions: Is this necessary? Does this make a day simpler, clearer, or more compassionate for someone? That is the kind of influence that I strive to bring to every piece of work.

## How I Work

Iâ€™m interning on a product team right now where Iâ€™ve been doing research, wireframing, high-fidelity UI design, and usability reviews. All stages of the process excite me-not that theyâ€™re flawless, but that I learn something from them every single time.

I love collaborating with other people. Idea discussion, getting feedback, and building together creates better solutions and smarter design. I like questioning things, drawing connections amongst patterns, and developing the little things that create a design that succeeds.

## What Matters To Me

- Design for purpose, not for embellishment
- User-centric processes led by empathy
- Free discussion where ideas evolve in dialogue
- Designing as a craft-a craft that I keep learning about and developing
- Simplicity and clarity, even in intricate systems

## Where I'm Headed

Though I'm just starting, I'm passionate about becoming a designer who creates thoughtful, considered products. I'm most interested in products that truly have an effect-whether that is making things more accessible, less cumbersome, or making people feel noticed and understood in an online space.

I'm open to trying new things, mentoring, and challenge-driven projects that challenge how I think and allow me to keep learning.
