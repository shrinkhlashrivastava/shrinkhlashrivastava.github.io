excerpt: "First Contact’s Search Member page was clunky, unintuitive, and overlooked. As core designer of user experience, I reimagined the experience - streamlining filters, redesigning member cards. By prototyping quickly and being close to our product and engineering teams, we transformed a forgotten page into a clear, reliable, and widely utilized tool."

## Search Member Page Redesign of "First Contact"

**Role:** UI/UX Designer

## The Challenge

The Search Member page had been overlooked. Its design felt disconnected, filters were confusing, and the member cards lacked structure. Many users didn’t even know it existed and those who did, didn’t trust it. It was clunky, underused, and clearly in need of a thoughtful redesign.

## My Role

As a core UI/UX designer on this project, I collaborated with another designer to rethink the experience from the ground up. I led the design direction, prototyped key interactions, and focused on keeping everything—from filters to member cards—clear, consistent, and on-brand. Working closely with product, dev, and community teams, I helped shape a solution that felt right across FC’s web, mobile, and metaverse platforms.

## The Process

We kicked things off with rapid prototyping, zeroing in on the biggest blocker: broken filters. They were unclear, unreliable, and often ignored. I redesigned the entire filter panel introducing clearer labels, grouped logic, and a collapsible layout to reduce visual noise and improve usability.

Once the filters felt more intuitive, I turned to the member cards. They lacked structure and varied wildly in format. I created flexible layouts for both minimal and content-rich profiles, ensuring consistency and easy scanning no matter how much information a user had added.

Originally, the Search Member page combined two flows in one view: a filter-driven search at the top and a full member list below. We explored separating them into tabs—placing users with completed profiles in an “Advanced Filters” section, and the rest in an “All Members” list. But after a quick check-in with the tech team confirmed our core goals were achievable in one view, we chose simplicity. We merged everything into a unified layout and resolved the remaining issues through fast, focused iteration.

That decision to keep things seamless, paired with a flexible approach, laid the foundation for the improvements that followed.

## Iteration

I tackled the member cards solo. At first they were mere placeholders—empty shapes with no real content. I fleshed each card out, arranging elements to match the types of information users would actually add. By testing both minimal and detailed layouts, I ensured every profile looked consistent and clear, no matter how much data appeared.

## The Outcome

The final design brought everything together into one clean, unified experience. Filters became easy to use and even easier to understand, with collapsible panels and clear, removable chips. Users saw instant feedback through a live result count, and whether they wanted to search by name or explore through filters, the interface flexed to fit.

Member cards were now consistent, accessible, and ready for any type of profile and visually, the page finally felt at home within the FC ecosystem.

## Reflection

This project was a reminder of how powerful early feedback can be. Asking the right questions up front especially with engineers helped us simplify before things got complicated. Even the smallest design details, like making filters visible or adding live result counts, had a big impact on user trust.

What started as a neglected, barely used page turned into something people actually wanted to explore. Clear, thoughtful UX didn’t just clean it up, it brought the feature back to life.
