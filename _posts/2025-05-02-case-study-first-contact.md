excerpt: "This case study outlines the process of redesigning a website's navigation menu to improve usability and accessibility. It walks through the steps taken‚Äîfrom auditing the existing structure and defining user personas to designing distinct experiences for logged-in and logged-out users, incorporating feedback, and finalizing a more intuitive and personalized menu system."

# A Navigation Makeover: How We Redesigned the Menu for Improved Usability

When we initially reviewed the site, we could tell something wasn't right‚Äîbut not in a glaring, broken manner. It was more nuanced than that. Users were coming to the site, and although everything "worked," nothing was intuitive.

One of the first observations we made was that the menu wasn't very well organized. Pages were everywhere‚Äîthere wasn't any sane logic. Bad, though: when a logged-in user finally got to view something different, it wasn't much. They still saw essentially the same menu with a tacked-on "Logout" option. That's it. No dashboard, no contextual notifications, nothing to help the experience seem customized or changed. It made no sense‚Äîand certainly wasn't assisting usability or accessibility.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Step 1: Mapping Out the Mess

We started by just laying everything out‚Äîa full list of all the pages, both public and member-only. It was a bit messy at first, but this step was crucial. Once we had everything in front of us, we began grouping the pages into logical categories. It already started to look more structured.

## Step 2: Knowing the Users

To push it a bit further, we developed some user personas. These weren't too detailed‚Äîjust enough to get us thinking through various scenarios.

- What would a new visitor want to see?  
- What about a returning, logged-in user?  
- How would an admin navigate?

This made us understand something crucial: the same menu wouldn't be possible for everyone. Logged-in users required a different experience‚Äîone that recognized they were now "inside" the system, not merely browsing from the outside.

---

## Step 3: Feedback, and Then. More Feedback

We brought our initial concepts to the manager. The critique was candid: it had to seem less complicated and more meaningful, particularly for visitors who were facing the site for the first time. That took us back to the drawing board to reconsider what that "initial contact" had to be when a user logged in.

---

## Step 4: Designing with Purpose

It was then we decided on two distinct menu experiences:

- **Logged-out users** ‚Äî clean, straightforward, and geared towards discovery.
- **Logged-in users** ‚Äî a slightly more dashboard-like menu, with easy access to member-focused features.

We created simple wireframes to illustrate how this might work. Not too high-fidelity at this stage‚Äîjust enough to facilitate discussion and get everyone on the same page.

---

## Step 5: Iterating with New Info

Right before we were to advance, there was new feedback from the technical team and updated priorities from the manager. Again, we reversed again‚Äîshuffled the arrangement, rearranged some items, and ensured information architecture matched real-world constraints.

## üèÅ The Final Product

At last, we produced a menu system that:

- Is personalized once you log in  
- Has definitive grouping and classification  
- Enhances usability and accessibility  
- Helps users actually find what they need without second-guessing

It wasn‚Äôt just a design update‚Äîit was a complete rethink of how users navigate the site. And honestly, it‚Äôs been one of the more satisfying UX challenges we‚Äôve tackled.
