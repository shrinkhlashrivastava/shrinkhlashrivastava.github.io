excerpt: "This case study outlines the process of redesigning a website's navigation menu to improve usability and accessibility. It walks through the steps taken‚Äîfrom auditing the existing structure and defining user personas to designing distinct experiences for logged-in and logged-out users, incorporating feedback, and finalizing a more intuitive and personalized menu system."

## Information Architecture Redesign of "First Contact"

**Role:** UI/UX Designer

**Tool:** Figma, Fig Jam

**Team:** Sapna(UI/UX Designer), Sreelakshmi(UI/UX Designer), Aayushi(Co-Founder of first contact and PM)

## Project Overview

During my UX internship, I was tasked with improving the usability and accessibility of the website‚Äôs main navigation. The problem: when users landed on the site, the menu was cluttered and poorly grouped. Even after logging in, they saw no change‚Äîjust the same outdated menu with a ‚ÄúLogout‚Äù option. This confused users and made navigation difficult.

The goal was to redesign the information architecture to provide a more intuitive, task-focused navigation experience, especially during what we called the user's ‚ÄúFirst Contact‚Äù after login.

## The Problem

The website's menu was cluttered and unclear. When users landed on the site, they struggled to find what they were looking for due to poorly grouped menu items. Even after logging in, the interface remained almost unchanged‚Äîusers saw the same menu with just a "Logout" button added, making them question whether their login was successful.

**Key Issues:**
- No distinction between guest and member navigation.
- Poor menu categorization and hierarchy.
- Low usability and accessibility.
- Confusing "First Contact" after login.

## The Goal

Redesign the site‚Äôs information architecture and navigation system to:
- Clearly separate experiences for guests and members.
- Group menu items logically for better usability.
- Make the logged-in experience feel purposeful and structured.
- Improve accessibility and overall user flow.

## The Process

### Research & Audit

I began with a content audit, mapping out:
- Pages available to all users
- Pages restricted to logged-in members

This helped expose where structure was lacking and which pages needed more visibility.

</div>

### User Personas

I developed basic personas representing:
- New visitors
- Logged-in members
- Admin users

This gave us a clearer understanding of different user goals and guided how we structured the navigation.

### Ideation

After mapping out the user journey, we brainstormed and explored:
- Dual interface paths: one for guests, one for logged-in users.
- Dashboard-style navigation for members.
- A top-level menu structure based on common tasks and mental models.

We also explored ‚Äúfirst-contact clarity‚Äù: what users expect to see immediately after logging in.

### Manager Insights: Shaping First Impressions

Early in the project, our team received focused, strategic guidance from the UX manager that shaped how we approached the redesign‚Äîespecially around the First Contact experience for new users.

üó£Ô∏è ‚ÄúA person who has no idea what First Contact is‚Äîwe have 3‚Äì5 seconds to get them interested.‚Äù

üó£Ô∏è ‚ÄúIf it doesn‚Äôt help the user sign up or sign in, it‚Äôs adding to their mental load.‚Äù

These insights helped us shift our mindset from ‚Äúshowing everything‚Äù to **only showing what matters**‚Äîsimplifying the layout, decluttering the homepage, and placing **Sign Up / Sign In** as the primary (and only) call to action for new users.


#### Design Priorities Informed by Feedback:

- **Keep it simple:** Avoid overwhelming first-time visitors with too many choices.
- **Lead with clarity:** Clearly communicate what First Contact is and who it‚Äôs for.
- **Remove distractions:** Eliminate any element that doesn‚Äôt help a user take the next step.
- **Position as a lifestyle space:** Make First Contact feel like a welcoming part of someone‚Äôs creative and queer journey‚Äînot just another platform.
- **Revisit the IA with fresh questions:**
    - What is First Contact?
	- Who is coming here?
	- Why are they coming?
	- What will make them join?

This feedback grounded our work and ensured we were always designing **with the right users‚Äîand the right goals‚Äîin mind.**

### Wireframing
I created low-fidelity wireframes to demonstrate how the menus would function. These included:
- Visual differences between guest and member views
- Improved grouping of menu items
- A clearer visual hierarchy

### Iteration

After wireframing, we received new insights from both:
- **The tech team** ‚Äì on implementation limitations and new findings.
- **The manager** ‚Äì regarding priority user flows.

We revised the information architecture accordingly:
- Simplified some categories.
- Prioritized frequently accessed features.
- Improved accessibility and visual hierarchy.

Later in the process, our manager reached out to me directly with updated thoughts on the navigation flow. Based on that conversation, I took the lead in reworking the layout‚Äîexploring new directions and showcasing how we could simplify without sacrificing usability.

This led to a revised top navigation model that better aligned with both user expectations and platform goals. It was a turning point where I got to contribute more independently and push the design forward.

After receiving direct feedback from the manager, I was asked to rethink the navigation flow. I took this as an opportunity not just to simplify the structure, but to **visually demonstrate what the new menu experience could look like.**

I created a quick layout mockup to showcase how a revised top nav could work‚Äîcleaner, more intuitive, and aligned with the platform's goals. This visual proposal helped the team see the potential of a simpler structure, and it ultimately shaped the direction we moved forward with.

## Solution

We delivered a **restructured, responsive menu experience:**
- Non-logged-in users now see a **simplified navigation**, focused on exploration.
- Logged-in users get a **personalized dashboard-style menu**, improving task flow and orientation.
- Menu items are now **grouped logically** and aligned with user expectations.
- A better **first impression after login**, reducing confusion and improving navigation confidence.

## Outcome & Learnings

This internship project gave me hands-on experience in solving real usability issues by reshaping the way users interact with a platform's information architecture. Through feedback, testing, and iteration, I learned to balance user needs with technical constraints while keeping the experience clear and engaging.

### What we learned:

We learned how important it is to **design with flexibility, collaborate across functions**, and **embrace iteration** as a core part of creating useful digital experiences.

My personal key takeaway:
> Designing a better "First Contact" isn't just about clean navigation‚Äîit‚Äôs about helping users feel not only oriented, but that this space belongs to them. The interface should welcome them, guide them, and reinforce that  they‚Äôre in the right place, with access to what matters most to them.

## Reiteration (Latest Update)

Originally, the "First Contact" experience included a top navigation bar, but as we considered how to enhance support for logged-in users, our team suggested a dashboard-style layout‚Äîa hybrid design that incorporated top and side navigation for enhanced task orientation.

Upon receiving feedback from the tech team and manager, and more investigation into technical limitations and user requirements, we ultimately came to the decision of reverting back to a reduced top navigation model. This final approach provided:
- Higher consistency across the platform
- A clearer layout that is more suitable for responsive design
- Simpler implementation within current systems

This design evolution represented our team's capability to be flexible and to prioritize simplicity over complexity. Although the dashboard-style layout had its merits, the return to a more streamlined top nav guaranteed improved usability, quicker development, and maintainability in the long run. This process of iteration showcased our capability to stay centered on what works best for users‚Äîeven if that means to simplify and reiterate rather than to add complexity.
